// Bundler note: this was Rollup + @rollup/plugin-{swc,terser,node-resolve,json}
// until 2026-09. That whole stack came from the rollup/plugins monorepo, which
// has had no commits since 2026-05-29 — and the swc plugin only existed because
// @rollup/plugin-typescript died on TypeScript 7 (the Go-native compiler no
// longer ships the JS compiler API). Rolldown does transpilation, minification,
// module resolution and JSON natively, so all four plugins and @swc/core are
// gone rather than replaced. Rolldown does NOT type-check, exactly as swc did
// not: `tsc --noEmit` remains the only type-check in the pipeline.
//
// Decorators are deliberately not configured here. Rolldown reads tsconfig.json
// itself and turns on Lit's legacy (experimental) decorators from it, so the
// swc block that used to derive target / experimentalDecorators /
// useDefineForClassFields by hand is gone. Verified per bundle by diffing the
// Lit reactive-property list before and after the migration.

// ROLLDOWN_WATCH and ROLLUP_WATCH to "true", and a plain `rolldown -c` sets

// settles on — and the failure mode it guards against is silent (dev builds
// shipping minified, prod builds shipping sourcemaps).

// comments that start with /*! or contain @license / @preserve.
